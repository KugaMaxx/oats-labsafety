# An On-site AR Training System: A Case Study on Laboratory Safety

OATS (On-site AR Training System) is an augmented reality software designed for 
providing on-site safety training. In this project, we use laboratory safety as 
a case study to demonstrate how we can deliver learning content to trainees 
without the need for personnel guidance. For more details, please refer to our 
published paper.

Main features:
- **Video Passthrough**: Surrounding objects in the real environment are clearly visible.
- **Room-Scale Motion**: Navigation can be achieved by simply moving your body.
- **Full Interaction**: Fully engage in the practical operations of safety training.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Meta Quest Link

### Installation

Please follow the steps below to complete the installation:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Connect headset to your computer via Meta Quest Link.
3. Open cloned project via Unreal Project Browser.
4. Played the default level in 'VR preview' mode.

### How to Play

Watch the training video and follow the narratorâ€™s instructions to perform the 
practical exercises. Most of the time, you will only need to **Grab (hold 
'trigger' and 'grip' simultaneously)**, but when necessary, you will need to 
**Interact (press 'B' or 'Y' button)** with the fire extinguisher to release the
